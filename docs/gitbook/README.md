## What is The Endex?

**The Endex** brings a living, breathing economy to your Minecraft server. Prices dynamically respond to player activity—buying drives prices up, selling pushes them down. Combined with a beautiful in-game GUI, optional web dashboard, virtual holdings system, and an extensible addon framework, The Endex offers everything you need for a sophisticated server economy.
